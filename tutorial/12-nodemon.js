//nodemon is a tool that runs your code and everytime you save something he just reruns it, 
//so you dont have to be doing node app.js every time.

//We install it as a devDependency with `npm i nodemon --save-dev` because we only use it for dev. When
//our app is deployed in production we will use something else. 

//In the package.json "scripts" lets you give commands to your app. So "start" : "node app.js", so when you run npm start
//you are running node app.js
